                this took me like a month, especially since i didn't really do any modeling for a lot of the days. i plan on 3d printing this and putting it on as a shell for a logitech m510. 1/7/23
                <br><br>i 3d printed it and lets just say that this model has so many flaws. firstly, due to how much support structures were needed to make this, i wasted a lot of filament. second, the bottom hole where the main pcb and stuff goes into is too big. lastly, the place where the switches interact with the rectangle thingy was measured incorrectly (should've been shorter). there were a couple more flaws than these but these were the main ones. 1/9/23

                tried having a go at sculpting in blender, turns out that blender sculpting is kinda awesome. i created this as an optional project at the end of the first semester in 8th grade. never got to finish it. if i do wanna finish it, i'll do it later because i honestly don't feel like it. 1/28/23

                it's basically a smart, low-cost device that detects carotid artery stenosis through intensity variation analysis for cerebrovascular accident prevention.
                <br><br>ehan masud and aneeq chowdhury did all the research and figuring out how to detect carotid artery in your neck for their science fair. i only take credit in for creating and designing the model that they used. as you can see in the picture above this model holds a camera and light source so that you can see the neck and stuff. foam was added for comfort purposes. 1/15/23
